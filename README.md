# Plotting a specific band at a specific-direction
These codes helped me with plotting some graphs exciting (http://exciting-code.org), a full-potential density functional theory (DFT) and many-body pertubation theory (MBPT) package

"EXTRACT_K.py" extracts k-point path from "KPOINTS.OUT" and generate an output file

"PLOT_from_EIGVAL.py" extracts energies from "EIGVAL.OUT" for a specific band

"BAND_DAT.py" combines the two to generate a data file for a specific band at a specific k-direction
